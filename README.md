# ADVENT-OF-CODE

My attempt at completing the challenges. My solutions are by no means perfect, but they work and i can definitely tidy them up.

Everything is written by me (and chatgpt for the first day as a test), and i have not looked up any hints. All of these solutions are mine. 


The only working solutions are the files named either day.py (like 5th.py) or day_pt2.py (like 20th_pt2.py).
