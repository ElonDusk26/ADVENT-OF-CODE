# ADVENT-OF-CODE

My attempt at completing the AOC challenges.

Everything is written by me (and chatgpt for the first day as a test), and i have not looked up any hints. All of these solutions are mine. 

Each folder is a solution to the given day. 

Within each folders there are 2 solutions. The first solution has a filename equal to the folder and ends with the file extension ".py", and the second solution has the suffix "_pt2.py".
